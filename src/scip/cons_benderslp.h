 * @name Benders Constraints
 *
 * Two constraint handlers are implemented for the generation of Benders' decomposition cuts. When included in a
 * problem, the Benders' decomposition constraint handlers generate cuts during the enforcement of LP and relaxation
 * solutions. Additionally, Benders' decomposition cuts can be generated when checking the feasibility of solutions with
 * respect to the subproblem constraints.
 *
 * This constraint handler has an enforcement priority that is greater than the integer constraint handler. This means
 * that all LP solutions will be first checked for feasibility with respect to the Benders' decomposition second stage
 * constraints before performing an integrality check. This is part of a multi-phase approach for solving mixed integer
 * programs by Benders' decomposition.
 *
 * A parameter is available to control the depth at which the non-integer LP solution are enforced by solving the
 * Benders' decomposition subproblems. This parameter is set to 0 by default, indicating that non-integer LP solutions
 * are enforced only at the root node.
